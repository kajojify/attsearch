attsearch
===================
This is my little project which I started just for fun. I keep developing it when I have free time. 

Now its functionality isn't very impressive, because the project is raw and on development stage. 

The script attsearch.py contains several useful function to simplify the work with Gmail. 

Basically, it connects to google <b>IMAP server</b> and search emails using keywords. Then the script gets all names of attachments <strong>(without downloading them)</strong> for determine email id. Finally, it downloads them (or just choosen ones) to the specified folder. 

So, as you can see, everything is pretty simple :) 

How to run
----------
Clone this repository. Then go to the repository directory.

Run the script:
```
python3 attsearch.py
```

Usage
-----

It hasn't any user-friendly interface except loging stage now, so I can't advice you to use this.

Use the functions if you need.
